# 🔧 KDUI - Take Bootstrap further!
KDUI is the first public framework very similar to Bootstrap made with help of the GitHub Copilot program! Our framework point to more customizable work, better design language updated to 2022 standards, and better understanding for everyone in the whole world.

# ❔ Why KDUI?
We made KDUI because of some problems we've wanted to erase and make by ourselves.

* Better design out of the box, no need to configure components in another CSS file
* Minimal use of languages like JavaScript to minimize extra work and skill to use KDUI
* Full out-of-the-box experience, no need to install npm packages, etc.
* Better support in customizing KDUI by yourself, set some extra options, and configure some properties
* Boomer-friendly, use `CTRL + F` to quickly find categories with classes or simply understand our code better

# 📂 Can I contribute and how?
Sure you can! You can always make a pull request, send your code and help us build the biggest customizable framework ever made!
We always welcome new members and contributors 😍

# 📅 When you'll finish this framework?
Because we don't have enough time to focus only on the KDUI, the expected publication is in winter 2022. As I always say, this is not official and can be changed anytime.

# 💻 How can I contact you?
You can contact `Kléma#2152` or `Dast#4558` on Discord for now. We will add our Discord server soon! 😃

### Have a great day!
KDUI inspired by Bootstrap 5 and TailwindCSS.
